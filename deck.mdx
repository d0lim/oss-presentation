# OVERVIEW

## From Tree

<Image
  src={treeImage}
  style={{
    marginLeft: "auto",
    marginRight: "auto",
    height: "50%",
    width: "80%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",
  }}
/>

---

## To Code

<Image
  src={codeImage}
  style={{
    marginLeft: "auto",
    marginRight: "auto",
    height: "50%",
    width: "80%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",
  }}
/>

---

## To Project Directory Structure

<Image
  src={directoryStructureImage}
  style={{
    marginLeft: "auto",
    marginRight: "auto",
    height: "50%",
    width: "80%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",

## With Empty Component

<Image
  src={emptyComponentImage}
  style={{
    marginLeft: "auto",
    marginRight: "auto",
    height: "50%",
    width: "50%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",

# Necessity

---

```jsx
<Import Statements>

...

<Components which returns jsx>

...

<Export Statements>
```

---

# Lots of repeated work

---

## Lots of code snippets

<Image
  src={codeSnippetImage1}
  style={{
    marginLeft: "auto",
    marginRight: "auto",
    height: "50%",
    width: "80%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",
  }}
/>

---

## Lots of code snippets

<Image
  src={codeSnippetImage2}
  style={{
    marginLeft: "auto",
    marginRight: "auto",
    height: "50%",
    width: "80%",
    backgroundSize: "contain",
